```

### Composables Architecture

The composables follow a **layered architecture** with clear separation of responsibilities:

```
composables/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                        # Core game logic layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useGameController.ts     # [MAIN] Central orchestrator
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useGame.ts               # Core game mechanics
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useGameLoader.ts         # Game initialization
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ engine/                      # Rendering engine layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useGameEngine.ts         # HTML5 Canvas engine
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useCanvasLayout.ts       # Layout calculations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useCanvasObjects.ts      # Object pooling system
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useCanvasInteraction.ts  # User interaction handling
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useCardRenderer.ts       # Card rendering logic
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                        # Data management layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useCS2Data.ts            # CS2 items API integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useSeedSystem.ts         # Seed generation and validation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useGamePersistence.ts    # Local storage management
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ sync/                        # Synchronization layer
    â””â”€â”€ useGameSync.ts           # State-to-canvas synchronization
```

### Application Flow

#### 1. **Initialization Flow**

```
pages/index.vue
    â†“
[Loading Screen] â†’ GameController.initializeGame()
    â†“
CS2Data.load() â†’ SeedSystem.init() â†’ Game.prepare()
    â†“
[Main Interface] â†’ GameInterface.vue
```

#### 2. **Game Start Flow**

```
User clicks "Start Game"
    â†“
GameController.startNewGame()
    â†“
SeedSystem.generateSeed() â†’ CS2Data.getItemsForGame()
    â†“
Game.initializeCards() â†’ Canvas.renderCards()
    â†“
[Game Playing State]
```

#### 3. **Card Selection Flow**

```
User clicks card on canvas
    â†“
Canvas.handleClick() â†’ Game.selectCard()
    â†“
CardStore.updateState() â†’ GameSync.queueSyncEvent()
    â†“
Canvas.updateVisualState() â†’ [Flip Animation]
    â†“
Game.checkForMatch() â†’ [Match Logic]
```

#### 4. **Real-time Synchronization**

```
Game State Changes (Pinia Stores)
    â†“
GameSync.watchChanges() â†’ Event Queue
    â†“
Batch Processing â†’ Canvas Updates
    â†“
Visual Effects â†’ User Feedback
```

#### 5. **Data Persistence Flow**

```
Game State Changes
    â†“
Auto-save Timer â†’ GamePersistence.save()
    â†“
localStorage â†’ State Recovery on reload
```

**Key Architectural Principles:**

- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, game logic, rendering, and data layers are independent
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time synchronization between state and visuals
- **Performance Optimization**: Object pooling, batched updates, and efficient rendering
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with strict type checking
- **Composable Design**: Reusable logic through Vue 3 Composition API
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling at component and system levels

This architecture ensures the game remains performant, maintainable, and extensible while providing a smooth user experience across all devices.
