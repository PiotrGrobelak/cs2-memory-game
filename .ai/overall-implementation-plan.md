# Implementation Plan

## Strategy Overview

This plan focuses on building solid application foundations before adding advanced features. The priority is creating a stable MVP with basic memory game functionality.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project and Environment Setup

- Initialize Nuxt 3 project with TypeScript
- Configure Tailwind CSS 4 and PrimeVue
- Set up Pinia store for state management
- Configure Vitest, Vue Test Utils and Playwright
- Folder structure and naming conventions

### Step 2: Basic Canvas Architecture

- Implement Canvas component in Vue
- Basic Game Engine class for rendering
- Canvas object management system
- Responsive Canvas configuration for different screen sizes

### Step 3: Basic Data Models

- Define TypeScript types for cards, game and state
- Card model with basic properties
- Game state (time, moves, matches)
- Pinia store implementation for game state

### Step 4: Card System - Basic Functionality

- Render cards on Canvas
- Basic flip animations (card flipping)
- Click detection logic on cards
- Card state management (hidden/shown/matched)

### Step 5: Basic Game Mechanics

- Card pair matching logic
- Move counter and timer
- Game completion after matching all pairs
- Basic user interface (start, restart)

### Step 6: Difficulty Levels

- Implementation of three difficulty levels (12, 24, 48 cards)
- Dynamic card layout on board
- Layout adaptation for different card quantities

### Step 7: CS2 API Integration

- Service for fetching CS2 weapons/items data
- Cache in localStorage for API data
- Map CS2 data to card objects
- Error handling and offline fallback

### Step 8: Seed System and Randomization

- Random seed generator
- Deterministic randomization based on seed
- Input for custom seeds
- Seed validation and normalization

### Step 9: Game State Persistence

- Save game state in localStorage
- Restore game after browser refresh
- Manage multiple game sessions (different seeds)
- Data migration during updates

### Step 10: Basic Visual Effects

- Smooth card flipping animations
- Basic hover and focus effects
- Background gradient based on CS2 item rarity
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Step 11: Audio System

- Web Audio API implementation
- Sounds for card flip and matches
- Volume control and mute functionality
- Support for different audio formats (OGG Vorbis + AAC)

### Step 12: Game History and Statistics

- Data model for game history
- Display previous results
- Statistics (best time, fewest moves)
- Export/import history data

### Step 13: QR Code Sharing

- Generate QR codes for seeds
- QR code scanning (if available in browser)
- Copy seeds to clipboard
- Sharing via URL

### Step 14: Parallax and Advanced Effects

- Parallax effects responding to mouse/touch movement
- Advanced transition animations
- Performance optimization for effects
- Responsive parallax for different devices

### Step 15: Performance Optimization

- Object pooling for cards
- Batch rendering on Canvas
- Lazy loading of images
- Preloading critical resources

### Step 16: Testing and Code Quality

- Unit tests for game logic
- Vue component tests
- E2E tests for main user flows
- Coverage testing and refactoring

### Step 17: Error Handling and Edge Cases

- Graceful API error handling
- Fallback for corrupted localStorage
- Handle low memory resources
- Error boundaries and logging

### Step 18: Final Polish and Deploy

- Cross-browser testing
- Performance auditing
- Basic accessibility support
- CI/CD configuration and deployment

## Advantages of this approach:

- Quick achievement of working MVP
- Solid foundations for future development
- Easier debugging at each stage
- Ability to test functionality from early stages
