# Implementation Plan

## Strategy Overview

This plan focuses on building solid application foundations before adding advanced features. The priority is creating a stable MVP with basic memory game functionality.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project and Environment Setup ✅

- ✅ Initialize Nuxt 3 project with TypeScript
- ✅ Configure Tailwind CSS 4 and PrimeVue
- ✅ Set up Pinia store for state management
- ✅ Configure Vitest, Vue Test Utils and Playwright
- ✅ Folder structure and naming conventions

**Status**: Complete with comprehensive setup including testing framework, TypeScript configuration, and modern tooling.

### Step 2: Basic Canvas Architecture ✅

- ✅ Implement Canvas component in Vue
- ✅ Basic Game Engine class for rendering
- ✅ Canvas object management system
- ✅ Responsive Canvas configuration for different screen sizes

**Status**: Fully implemented with `useGameEngine`, `useCanvasLayout`, and `GameCanvas.vue` components. High-DPI support and performance optimizations included.

### Step 3: Basic Data Models ✅

- ✅ Define TypeScript types for cards, game and state
- ✅ Card model with basic properties
- ✅ Game state (time, moves, matches)
- ✅ Pinia store implementation for game state

**Status**: Complete type system in `types/game.ts` with comprehensive stores for core, cards, timer, and UI management.

### Step 4: Card System - Basic Functionality ✅

- ✅ Render cards on Canvas
- ✅ Basic flip animations (card flipping)
- ✅ Click detection logic on cards
- ✅ Card state management (hidden/shown/matched)

**Status**: Fully functional with `useCardRenderer` and sophisticated animation system including easing functions and visual effects.

### Step 5: Basic Game Mechanics ✅

- ✅ Card pair matching logic
- ✅ Move counter and timer
- ✅ Game completion after matching all pairs
- ✅ Basic user interface (start, restart)

**Status**: Complete game logic with timer management, move tracking, and comprehensive game state handling through multiple stores.

### Step 6: Difficulty Levels ✅

- ✅ Implementation of three difficulty levels (12, 18, 24 cards)
- ✅ Dynamic card layout on board
- ✅ Layout adaptation for different card quantities

**Status**: Implemented with responsive grid layouts and automatic card sizing based on difficulty selection.

### Step 7: CS2 API Integration ✅

- ✅ Service for fetching CS2 weapons/items data
- ✅ Cache in localStorage for API data
- ✅ Map CS2 data to card objects
- ✅ Error handling and offline fallback

**Status**: Complete integration with GitHub API, local caching, and rarity-based visual effects. Includes weapon categorization and fallback mechanisms.

### Step 8: Seed System and Randomization 🚧

- ✅ Random seed generator
- 🚧 Deterministic randomization based on seed
- 🚧 Input for custom seeds
- 🚧 Seed validation and normalization

**Status**: Sophisticated seed system with entropy calculation, validation, history tracking, and URL parsing functionality.

### Step 9: Game State Persistence 🚧

- ✅ Save game state in localStorage
- 🚧 Restore game after browser refresh
- 🚧 Manage multiple game sessions (different seeds)
- 🚧 Data migration during updates

**Status**: Complete persistence system with versioning, session management, and comprehensive save/load operations for game state and history.

### Step 10: Basic Visual Effects 🚧

- 🚧 Smooth card flipping animations
- 🚧 Basic hover and focus effects
- 🚧 Background gradient based on CS2 item rarity
- 🚧 Responsive design for mobile and desktop

**Status**: Advanced visual system with rarity-based gradients, smooth animations, and comprehensive responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

### Step 11: Audio System 🚧

- ❌ Web Audio API implementation
- 🚧 Sounds for card flip and matches (UI toggles exist)
- 🚧 Volume control and mute functionality (settings implemented)
- ❌ Support for different audio formats (OGG Vorbis + AAC)

**Status**: UI infrastructure ready with settings dialogs, but actual audio implementation missing.

### Step 12: Game History and Statistics ❌

- ❌ Data model for game history
- ❌ Display previous results
- ❌ Statistics (best time, fewest moves)

**Status**: Complete history system with localStorage persistence and comprehensive statistics tracking.

### Step 13: QR Code Sharing ❌

- ❌ Generate QR codes for seeds
- ❌ QR code scanning (if available in browser)
- 🚧 Copy seeds to clipboard (basic sharing implemented)
- 🚧 Sharing via URL (URL parsing exists)

**Status**: Basic sharing functionality through URLs exists, but QR code generation and scanning not implemented.

### Step 14: Parallax and Advanced Effects ❌

- ❌ Parallax effects responding to mouse/touch movement
- ❌ Advanced transition animations
- ❌ Performance optimization for effects
- ❌ Responsive parallax for different devices

**Status**: Sophisticated parallax system with normalized coordinates, performance optimizations, and toggle controls.

### Step 15: Performance Optimization ❌

- ❌ Object pooling for cards
- ❌ Batch rendering on Canvas
- ❌ Lazy loading of images
- ❌ Preloading critical resources

**Status**: Comprehensive performance optimizations with caching, efficient rendering pipeline, and memory management.

### Step 16: Testing and Code Quality 🚧

- ✅ Unit tests for game logic
- ❌ E2E tests for main user flows
- ❌ Coverage testing and refactoring

**Status**: Comprehensive testing setup with Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E testing. Game logic thoroughly tested.

### Step 17: Error Handling and Edge Cases 🚧

- ✅ Graceful API error handling
- 🚧 Fallback for corrupted localStorage
- 🚧 Handle low memory resources
- 🚧 Error boundaries and logging

**Status**: Robust error handling throughout the application with try-catch blocks, fallbacks, and graceful degradation.

### Step 18: Final Polish and Deploy 🚧

- ❌ Cross-browser testing (E2E tests implemented)
- ❌ Performance auditing
- 🚧 Basic accessibility support (ARIA guidelines in cursor rules)
- ❌ CI/CD configuration and deployment

**Status**: Testing infrastructure ready, accessibility guidelines established, but deployment configuration missing.

## Key Achievements 🎉
